    # You should use this tag when you have a high quality, episode-specific image you would like listeners to see.
    # Specify your episode artwork using the <a href> attribute in the <itunes:image> tag.
    # Depending on their device, listeners see your episode artwork in varying sizes.
    # Therefore, make sure your design is effective at both its original size and at thumbnail size.
    # You should include a title, brand, or source name as part of your episode artwork.
    # To avoid technical issues when you update your episode artwork, be sure to:
    # Change the artwork file name and URL at the same time
    # Verify the web server hosting your artwork allows HTTP head requests
    # Artwork must be a minimum size of 1400 x 1400 pixels and a maximum size of 3000 x 3000 pixels,
    # in JPEG or PNG format, 72 dpi, with appropriate file extensions (.jpg, .png), and in the RGB colorspace.
    # These requirements are different from the standard RSS image tag specifications.
    # Make sure the file type in the URL matches the actual file type of the image file.d
